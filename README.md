## Welcome to the TEKSI drinking water Module GitHub Home page 👋
TEKSI drinking water module (project name: QWAT) is a selection of tools and a database implementation that allows you to:

* manage and map the data of your drinking water network with all its components such as pipes, valves, pumps, tanks, etc.
* indicate the characteristics of network objects in the form of attributes such as diameter, material, installation depth, leaks, date of installation, etc.
* produce plans and extract statistics from the database such as network value, total length of pipes, identification of future interventions, etc.
* export geodata in compliance with the requirements of Swiss standards


TEKSI drinking water module is a complete open source module based on a PostgreSQL - PostGIS data model almost compatible with the swiss norm SIA405. The data are accessed and edited with a dedicated QGIS project.
The project is maintained by the [TEKSI community](https://www.teksi.ch)

[TEKSI](https://www.teksi.ch) is a non profit swiss association set up to support open source professional GIS projects aiming to ease the management of public infrastructures. [TEKSI GitHub Home page](https://github.com/TEKSI)
